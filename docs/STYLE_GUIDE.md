# OCaml Coding Style Guide

This document outlines the coding and testing conventions for this project. The goal is to ensure the codebase is clear, robust, and maintainable. The style is inspired by the best practices of the modern OCaml ecosystem, emphasizing modularity and pragmatism.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Interface-First Design**: Always start by designing the module's interface in the `.mli` file. A clean interface is more critical than a clever implementation.

2. **Modularity**: Build small, focused modules that do one thing well. Compose them to build larger systems.

3. **Simplicity and Clarity (KISS)**: Prioritize clarity over conciseness. Strive for the simplest possible solution and avoid overly clever or obscure constructs.

4. **Explicitness**: Make control flow and error handling explicit. Avoid exceptions for recoverable errors.

5. **Purity and Side-Effect Management**: Prefer pure functions. Isolate side-effects (I/O, state mutation) at the edges of the application. This is a fundamental principle for building maintainable, testable, and composable systems.

6. **Be Deliberate with Dependencies**: Every dependency has a cost - maintenance burden, increased compile times, and expanded API surface. Before adding a new dependency, consider if the functionality can be achieved with existing tools or a small amount of code. When you do add dependencies, choose high-quality, well-maintained libraries.

7. **NEVER USE Obj.magic**: The `Obj` module is not part of the OCaml language and breaks type safety. There is always a better, type-safe solution.

### [E100] Unsafe Type Casting

This issue means you're using unsafe type casting that can crash your
program. Fix it by replacing Obj.magic with proper type definitions,
variant types, or GADTs to represent different cases safely.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let coerce x = Obj.magic x
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* Use proper type conversions *)
let int_of_string_opt s =
  try Some (int_of_string s) with _ -> None

(* Or use variant types *)
type value = Int of int | String of string
let to_int = function Int i -> Some i | _ -> None
```


## Dependencies and Tooling

**Build System**: The project is built exclusively with `dune`.

**Formatting**: All code is formatted automatically with `ocamlformat`. Run `dune fmt` before committing. Ensure you have a `.ocamlformat` file in your project root.

### [E500] Missing Code Formatter

This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix it by
creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile = default'
and a version number to ensure consistent formatting.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* No .ocamlformat file in project root *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* This project has .ocamlformat configured *)
let well_formatted = true
```


**Core Libraries**: Projects typically embrace a curated set of high-quality libraries for common tasks. For example:

- **Concurrency**: `eio`

- **Structured Output**: `fmt` (instead of Printf/Format)

### [E205] Consider Using Fmt Module

This is a style suggestion. While Printf and Format are part of OCaml's
standard library and perfectly fine to use, the Fmt library offers additional
features like custom formatters and better composability. Consider using Fmt
for new code, but Printf/Format remain valid choices for many use cases.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let make_error msg line = 
  Printf.sprintf "Error: %s at line %d" msg line
let print_count n = 
  Printf.printf "Processing %d items...\n" n
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* Requires: opam install fmt *)
let make_error msg line = 
  Fmt.str "Error: %s at line %d" msg line
let print_count n = 
  Fmt.pr "Processing %d items...@." n
```


- **Regular Expressions**: `re` (instead of Str module)

### [E200] Outdated Str Module

This issue means you're using the outdated Str module for regular
expressions. Fix it by switching to the modern Re module: add 're' to your
dune dependencies and replace Str functions with Re equivalents.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let contains_at s = 
  Str.string_match (Str.regexp ".*@.*") s 0
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* Requires: opam install re *)
let at_re = Re.compile (Re.str "@")
let contains_at s = Re.execp at_re s
```


- **Logging**: `logs`

- **CLI Parsing**: `cmdliner`

- **JSON Handling**: `yojson`

- **HTTP**: `cohttp-eio`

- **Test Framework**: `Alcotest`

## Module and Interface Design

**Documentation**: Every `.mli` file must begin with a top-level documentation comment explaining its purpose. Focus on *what* the module provides, not *how* it is implemented.

### [E400] Missing Module Documentation

This issue means your modules lack documentation making them hard to
understand. Fix it by adding module documentation at the top of .mli files
with a brief summary and description of the module's purpose.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type t = string
let create s = s
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type t = string
let create s = s
```


```ocaml
(** User API

    This module provides types and functions for interacting with users. *)
```

**Interface (`.mli`) Style**: Document every exported value. Use a consistent, concise style.

### [E405] Missing Value Documentation

This issue means your public functions and values lack documentation making
them hard to use. Fix it by adding documentation comments that explain what
each function does, its parameters, and return value.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type t
val parse : string -> t
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type t

(** [parse str] converts a string to type [t].
    @raise Invalid_argument if [str] is malformed. *)
val parse : string -> t
```


**Documentation Philosophy**: For functions, use the `[function_name arg1 arg2] is ...` pattern.

```ocaml
val is_bot : t -> bool
(** [is_bot u] is [true] if [u] is a bot user. *)
```

For values, describe what the value represents.

```ocaml
type id = string
(** A user identifier. *)
```

**Abstract Types**: Keep types abstract (`type t`) whenever possible. Expose smart constructors and accessors instead of record fields to maintain invariants.

**Standard Interfaces for Data Types**: For modules defining a central data type `t`, consistently provide these functions where applicable:

### [E415] Missing Standard Functions

This issue means your types lack standard functions making them hard to use
in collections and debugging. Fix it by implementing equal, compare, pp
(pretty-printer), and to_string functions for your types.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type user = { id: int; name: string }
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type user = { id: int; name: string }
val equal : user -> user -> bool
val compare : user -> user -> int
val pp : Format.formatter -> user -> unit
```


- `val v : ... -> t`: A pure, smart constructor for creating values of type `t` in memory. This function should not perform any I/O.

- `val create : ... -> (t, Error.t) result`: A function that performs a side-effect, like an API call, to create a resource.

- `val pp : t Fmt.t`: A pretty-printer for logging and debugging.

- `val equal : t -> t -> bool`: A structural equality function.

- `val compare : t -> t -> int`: A comparison function for sorting.

- `val of_json : Yojson.Safe.t -> (t, string) result`: For parsing from JSON.

- `val to_json : t -> Yojson.Safe.t`: For serializing to JSON.

- `val validate : t -> (t, string) result`: For validating the integrity of the data.

## Project Structure

**Interface Files**: Create `.mli` files for all public modules to define clear interfaces and hide implementation details.

### [E505] Missing Interface Files

This issue means your modules lack interface files making their public API
unclear. Fix it by creating .mli files that document which functions and
types should be public. Copy public signatures from the .ml file and remove
private ones.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type t = { name: string; id: int }
let create name id = { name; id }
let name t = t.name
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type t = { name: string; id: int }
let create name id = { name; id }
let name t = t.name
```


**Code Formatting**: Maintain a `.ocamlformat` file in the project root with consistent formatting settings.

### [E500] Missing Code Formatter

This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix it by
creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile = default'
and a version number to ensure consistent formatting.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* No .ocamlformat file in project root *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* This project has .ocamlformat configured *)
let well_formatted = true
```


## Command-Line Applications

For command-line applications in the `bin/` directory, it's common to use a library like `Cmdliner`.

**Shared Functionality**: Common functionality, such as authentication and logging setup, can be placed in a shared module (e.g., `bin/common.ml`).

**`run` function**: A shared module might provide a `run` function that initializes the application's main loop and environment (e.g., an Eio loop). This should be used by all commands to ensure a consistent environment.

## Error Handling

We use the `result` type for all recoverable errors. Exceptions are reserved for programming errors (e.g., `Invalid_argument`).

**Central Error Type**: Define a single, comprehensive error type for the library (e.g., in `lib/error.ml`).

```ocaml
(* In lib/error.mli *)
type t = [
  | `Api of string * Yojson.Safe.t (* code, fields *)
  | `Json_parse of string
  | `Network of string
  | `Msg of string
]

val pp : t Fmt.t
```

**Error Helpers**: In implementation files, use helper functions to construct errors. This ensures consistency.

```ocaml
(* In an implementation file *)
let err_api code fields = Error (`Api (code, fields))
let err_parse msg = Error (`Json_parse msg)

let find_user_id json =
  match Yojson.Safe.Util.find_opt "id" json with
  | Some (`String id) -> Ok id
  | Some _ -> err_parse "Expected string for user ID"
  | None -> err_parse "Missing user ID"
```

**No Broad Exceptions**: Never use `try ... with _ -> ...`. Always match on specific exceptions.

### [E105] Catch-all Exception Handler

This issue means you're catching all exceptions with a wildcard pattern,
which can hide unexpected errors and make debugging difficult. Fix it by
handling specific exceptions explicitly. If you must catch all exceptions,
at least log them before re-raising or handling.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
try int_of_string "abc" with _ -> 0
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
try int_of_string "abc" with
| Failure _ -> 0
| exn -> print_endline "unexpected"; raise exn
```


**No Silenced Warnings**: Fix underlying issues instead of silencing compiler warnings with attributes like `[@warning "-nn"]`.

### [E110] Silenced Compiler Warnings

This issue means you're hiding compiler warnings that indicate potential
problems. Fix it by removing warning silencing attributes and addressing
the underlying issues that trigger the warnings.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
[@@@ocaml.warning "-32"] (* unused value *)
let unused_function x = x + 1
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* Remove unused code or use it *)
let helper x = x + 1
let result = helper 42
```


**Initialization Failures**: For unrecoverable errors during startup (e.g., missing configuration), it is acceptable to fail fast using `Fmt.failwith`.

```ocaml
let tls_config =
  match Tls.Config.client ~authenticator () with
  | Ok config -> config
  | Error (`Msg msg) -> Fmt.failwith "Failed to create TLS config: %s" msg
```

## Naming and Formatting

**File Naming**: Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `user_profile.ml`).

**Module Naming**: Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `user_profile`).

### [E305] Module Naming Convention

This issue means your module names don't follow OCaml naming conventions.
Fix them by using underscores between words while keeping the first letter capitalized (e.g., MyModule → My_module).

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
module UserProfile = struct end
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
module User_profile = struct end
```


**Type Naming**: The primary type in a module is `t`. Identifiers are named `id`. Use snake_case for all type names.

### [E315] Type Naming Convention

This issue means your type names don't follow OCaml naming conventions. Fix
them by renaming to snake_case (e.g., myType → my_type).

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type userProfile = { name : string }
type http_response = HttpOk | HttpError
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type user_profile = { name: string }
type http_response = Ok | Error
```


**Variant Constructors**: Use Snake_case for variant constructors (e.g., `Waiting_for_input`, `Processing_data`), not CamelCase.

### [E300] Variant Naming Convention

This issue means your variant constructors don't follow OCaml naming
conventions. Fix them by renaming to Snake_case (e.g., MyVariant →
My_variant).

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type status = 
  | WaitingForInput
  | ProcessingData
  | ErrorOccurred
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type status = 
  | Waiting_for_input  (* Snake_case *)
  | Processing_data
  | Error_occurred
```


**Values**: Short, descriptive, and lowercase with underscores (e.g., `find_user`, `create_channel`).

### [E310] Value Naming Convention

This issue means your value names don't follow OCaml naming conventions.
Fix them by renaming to snake_case (e.g., myValue → my_value).

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
type user = { name : string }
let myValue = 42
let getUserName user = user.name
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
type user = { name : string }
let my_value = 42
let get_user_name user = user.name
```


**Long Identifiers**: Avoid excessively long names with many underscores. Keep names concise and meaningful.

### [E320] Long Identifier Names

This issue means your identifier has too many underscores (more than 4) making it hard to
read. Fix it by removing redundant prefixes and suffixes:

• In test files: remove 'test_' prefix (e.g., test_check_foo → check_foo or
  just foo)
• In hint files: remove '_hint' suffix (e.g., complexity_hint → complexity)
• In modules: remove '_module' suffix (e.g., parser_module → parser)
• Remove redundant words that repeat the context (e.g., check_mli_doc →
  check_mli)

The file/module context already makes the purpose clear.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let get_user_profile_data_from_database_by_id () = 42
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
let get_user_by_id () = 42
```


**Function Naming**: Use `get_*` for extraction (returns value directly), `find_*` for search (returns option type).

### [E325] Function Naming Pattern

This issue means your function names don't match their return types. Fix
them by using consistent naming: get_* for extraction (returns value
directly), find_* for search (returns option type).

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let get_user () = None  (* returns option but named get_* *)
let find_name () = "John"  (* returns string but named find_* *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
let find_user () = None  (* returns option, correctly named *)
let get_name () = "John"  (* returns string, correctly named *)
```


**Labels**: Use labels only when they clarify the meaning of an argument, not for all arguments. Avoid `~f` and `~x`.

**Formatting**: Trust `ocamlformat`. No manual formatting.

## API Design

**Avoid Boolean Blindness**: Never use multiple boolean arguments in a function - they make call sites ambiguous and error-prone. Instead, use explicit variant types that leverage OCaml's type system for clarity.

```ocaml
(* BAD - Boolean blindness *)
let create_widget visible bordered = ...
let w = create_widget true false  (* What does this mean? *)

(* GOOD - Explicit variants *)
type visibility = Visible | Hidden
type border = With_border | Without_border
let create_widget ~visibility ~border = ...
let w = create_widget ~visibility:Visible ~border:Without_border
```

**Use Phantom Types for Safety**: When appropriate, use phantom types to enforce invariants at compile time rather than runtime.

**Builder Pattern for Complex Configuration**: For functions with many optional parameters, consider using a builder pattern with a record type rather than many optional arguments.

## Function Design

**Keep Functions Small and Focused**: A function should do one thing well. Decompose complex logic into smaller, well-defined helper functions. This improves readability, testability, and reusability. Aim for functions under 50 lines. As a rule of thumb, avoid deep nesting of `match` or `if` statements; more than two or three levels is a strong signal that the function should be refactored.

### [E005] Long Functions

This issue means your functions are too long and hard to read. Fix them by
extracting logical sections into separate functions with descriptive names.
Note: Functions with pattern matching get additional allowance (2 lines per case).
Pure data structures (lists, records) are also exempt from length checks.
For better readability, consider using helper functions for complex logic.
Aim for functions under 50 lines of actual logic.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let process_all_data x y z =
  (* This function is intentionally long to demonstrate the rule *)
  let a = x + 1 in
  let b = y + 1 in
  let c = z + 1 in
  let d = a * 2 in
  let e = b * 2 in
  let f = c * 2 in
  let g = d + e in
  let h = e + f in
  let i = f + d in
  let j = g * 2 in
  let k = h * 2 in
  let l = i * 2 in
  let m = j + k in
  let n = k + l in
  let o = l + j in
  let p = m * 2 in
  let q = n * 2 in
  let r = o * 2 in
  let s = p + q in
  let t = q + r in
  let u = r + p in
  let v = s * 2 in
  let w = t * 2 in
  let x1 = u * 2 in
  let y1 = v + w in
  let z1 = w + x1 in
  let a1 = x1 + v in
  let b1 = y1 * 2 in
  let c1 = z1 * 2 in
  let d1 = a1 * 2 in
  let e1 = b1 + c1 in
  let f1 = c1 + d1 in
  let g1 = d1 + b1 in
  let h1 = e1 * 2 in
  let i1 = f1 * 2 in
  let j1 = g1 * 2 in
  let k1 = h1 + i1 in
  let l1 = i1 + j1 in
  let m1 = j1 + h1 in
  let n1 = k1 * 2 in
  let o1 = l1 * 2 in
  let p1 = m1 * 2 in
  let q1 = n1 + o1 in
  let r1 = o1 + p1 in
  let s1 = p1 + n1 in
  let t1 = q1 * 2 in
  let u1 = r1 * 2 in
  let v1 = s1 * 2 in
  let w1 = t1 + u1 in
  let x2 = u1 + v1 in
  let y2 = v1 + t1 in
  let result = w1 + x2 + y2 in
  result
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
let step1 x y = (x + 1, y + 1)
let step2 (a, b) = (a * 2, b * 2)
let combine (c, d) = (c + d) * 2

let process_all x y =
  let (a, b) = step1 x y in
  let (c, d) = step2 (a, b) in
  combine (c, d)
```


### [E010] Deep Nesting

This issue means your code has too many nested conditions making it hard to
follow. Fix it by using pattern matching, early returns with 'when' guards,
or extracting nested logic into helper functions.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let process x y z =
  if x > 0 then
    if y > 0 then
      if z > 0 then
        if x < 100 then
          x + y + z
        else 0
      else 0
    else 0
  else 0
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
let process x y z =
  if x <= 0 || y <= 0 || z <= 0 then 0
  else if x >= 100 then 0
  else x + y + z
```


**Complexity Management**: Break down functions with high 
             cyclomatic complexity into smaller, focused helper functions with 
             clear names.

### [E001] High Cyclomatic Complexity

This issue means your functions have too much conditional logic. Fix them
by extracting complex logic into smaller helper functions with clear names
that describe their purpose.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
let check_input x y z =
  if x > 0 then
    if y > 0 then
      if z > 0 then
        if x + y > z then
          if y + z > x then
            if x + z > y then
              "valid"
            else "invalid"
          else "invalid"
        else "invalid"
      else "invalid"
    else "invalid"
  else "invalid"
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
let check_positive x = x > 0

let check_triangle x y z =
  x + y > z && y + z > x && x + z > y

let check_input x y z =
  if not (check_positive x && check_positive y && check_positive z) then
    "invalid"
  else if not (check_triangle x y z) then
    "invalid"
  else
    "valid"
```


**Composition over Abstraction**: Favor the composition of small, 
             concrete functions to build up complex behavior. Avoid deep 
             abstractions and complex class hierarchies.

**Data-Oriented Design**: Design functions to operate on simple, 
             immutable data structures (records, variants, etc.). Avoid 
             creating complex objects with hidden internal state.

**Avoid Premature Generalization**: Write code that solves the 
             problem at hand. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity or 
             generality that is not required by the current needs of the 
             project.

## Logging

Effective logging is crucial for debugging and monitoring. We use the `logs` library for all logging.

**Log Source**: Each module should define its own log source.

```ocaml
let log_src = Logs.Src.create "project_name.module_name"
module Log = (val Logs.src_log log_src : Logs.LOG)
```

**Log Levels**: Use the following log levels appropriately:

- `Log.app`: For messages that should always be shown to the user (e.g., startup messages).

- `Log.err`: For errors that have been handled but are critical enough to report.

- `Log.warn`: For potential issues that do not prevent the current operation from completing.

- `Log.info`: For informational messages about the application's state.

- `Log.debug`: For detailed, verbose messages useful for debugging.

**Structured Logging**: Use tags to add structured context to log messages. This is especially useful for machine-readable logs.

```ocaml
Log.info (fun m ->
    m "Received event: %s" event_type
      ~tags:(Logs.Tag.add "channel_id" channel_id Logs.Tag.empty))
```

## Testing

## Core Testing Philosophy

1. **Unit Tests First**: Prioritize unit tests for individual modules and functions.

2. **1:1 Test Coverage**: Every module in `lib/` should have a corresponding test module in `test/`.

### [E605] Missing Test Coverage

This issue means some of your library modules lack test coverage making
bugs more likely. Fix it by creating corresponding test files for each
library module to ensure your code works correctly.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* lib/parser.ml exists but no test/test_parser.ml *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* test/test_parser.ml *)
let test_parse = fun () -> ()
let test_errors = fun () -> ()
let suite = ("parser", [test_parse; test_errors])
```


### [E610] Orphaned Test Files

This issue means you have test files that don't correspond to any library
module making your test organization confusing. Fix it by either removing
orphaned test files or creating the corresponding library modules.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* test/test_old_feature.ml exists but lib/old_feature.ml was removed *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* Remove test/test_old_feature.ml or restore lib/old_feature.ml *)
```


3. **Test Organization**: Test files should export a `suite` value.

### [E600] Test Module Convention

This issue means your test files don't follow the expected convention for
test organization. Fix it by exporting a 'suite' value instead of running
tests directly, allowing better test composition and organization.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* test.ml - main test executable *)
let tests = []
let () = Alcotest.run "test_user" [("user", tests)]
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* test.ml - main test executable *)
let suite = ("user", [])
let () = Alcotest.run "Test suite description" [suite]
```


4. **Test Inclusion**: All test suites must be included in the main test runner.

### [E615] Excluded Test Suites

This issue means some test suites aren't included in your main test runner
so they never get executed. Fix it by adding them to the main test runner
to ensure all tests are run during development.

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**
```ocaml
(* test/test.ml *)
module Test_user = struct
  let suite = ("user", [])
end
let () = Alcotest.run "all" [Test_user.suite] 
(* Missing Test_parser.suite *)
```

✅ **Good:**
```ocaml
(* test/test.ml *)
module Test_user = struct
  let suite = ("user", [])
end
module Test_parser = struct
  let suite = ("parser", [])
end
let () = Alcotest.run "all" [
  Test_user.suite;
  Test_parser.suite
]
```


5. **Clear Test Names**: Test names should describe what they test, not how.

6. **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be independent and not rely on external state.

## Test Structure

**`test/test.ml`**: A main test runner that aggregates test suites from individual `test_*.ml` files.

**`test/test_*.ml`**: Each `test_*.ml` file contains the tests for a specific module.

**`test/dune`**: Defines the test executable.

**Individual Test Files**: Each `test_*.ml` file should export a `suite` value of type `(string * Alcotest.test_case list) list`.

**Test Naming Convention**:

- Test suite names should be lowercase, single words (e.g., `"users"`, `"commands"`)

- Test case names should be lowercase with underscores, concise but descriptive (e.g., `"list"`, `"create"`, `"parse_error"`)

## Writing Good Tests

**Function Coverage**: Test all public functions exposed in `.mli` files, including success, error, and edge cases.

**Test Data**: Use helper functions to create test data.

**Property-Based Testing**: For complex logic, consider property-based testing with QCheck.

## End-to-End Testing with Cram

Cram tests are essential for verifying the behavior of the final executable.

**Use Cram Directories**: Every Cram test should be a directory ending in `.t` (e.g., `my_feature.t/`).

**Create Actual Test Files**: Avoid embedding code within the `run.t` script using `cat > file << EOF`. Create real source files within the test directory.

## Running Tests

```ocaml
# Run all tests
dune test

# Run tests and watch for changes
dune test -w

# Run tests with coverage

## Commit Messages

We follow a structured format for commit messages to ensure they are clear, informative, and easy to read. A good commit message provides context for why a change was made.

## Format

A commit message consists of a short, imperative title followed by a more detailed body.

**Title**: A single, concise line summarizing the change.

- Keep it under 50 characters.

- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Do not end the title with a period.

**Body**: A detailed explanation of the change, separated from the title by a blank line.

- Wrap the body at 72 characters.

- The body should be structured into paragraphs that implicitly answer three questions:

  1. **What** does this change do?

  2. **Why** was this change necessary?

  3. **How** was this change implemented?

## Example

```ocaml
feat(parser): Add support for parsing logical operators

This change introduces the capability to parse logical `AND` and `OR`
operators in the expression language. It extends the lexer to
recognize `&&` and `||` and updates the parser with new rules for
logical expressions.

The expression language previously lacked support for combining
conditions, which was a significant limitation for writing complex
business rules. This feature was requested by users to allow for more
flexible and powerful queries.

The implementation involved extending the lexer's token set with `AND`
and `OR` tokens and updating the parser's precedence rules. New AST
nodes for `LogicalAnd` and `LogicalOr` were added, and the evaluator
was updated to handle them.
```

## AI Assistants

AI assistants may be used to help write code, but the final commit must be authored by a human developer. Do not use `Co-authored-by:` trailers for AI assistants.
