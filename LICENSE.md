## AI-Generated Code Notice

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools ([Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) by Anthropic). While we have chosen to license this work under the MIT License, users should be aware that:

1. **Legal uncertainty**: The copyright status, license implications, and liability for AI-generated code remain legally untested.

2. **Training data**: We cannot trace which training data influenced specific code patterns or determine the original licensing of such data.

3. **Use at your own risk**: By using this software, you acknowledge these uncertainties and agree to use it at your own discretion.

For more context on these issues, see discussions by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/) and [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-questions-around-copilot/) regarding AI-generated code.

Despite these uncertainties, we believe this tool provides value to the OCaml community and are committed to maintaining it with full transparency about its AI origins.
