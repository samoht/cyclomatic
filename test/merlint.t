  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix
            it by creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile =
            default' and a version number to ensure consistent formatting.
    â€¢ [E505] This issue means your modules lack interface files making their
            public API unclear. Fix it by creating .mli files that document which
            functions and types should be public. Copy public signatures from the .ml
            file and remove private ones.

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E005] This issue means your functions are too long and hard to read. Fix
            them by extracting logical sections into separate functions with
            descriptive names. Aim for functions under 50 lines.
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E300] This issue means your variant constructors don't follow OCaml
            naming conventions. Fix them by renaming to Snake_case (e.g., MyVariant
            â†’ My_variant).
    â€¢ [E310] This issue means your value names don't follow OCaml naming
            conventions. Fix them by renaming to snake_case (e.g., myValue â†’
            my_value).
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E400] This issue means your modules lack documentation making them hard
            to understand. Fix it by adding module documentation at the top of .mli
            files with a brief summary and description of the module's purpose.
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix
            it by creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile =

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E100] This issue means you're using unsafe type casting that can crash
            your program. Fix it by replacing Obj.magic with proper type definitions,
            variant types, or GADTs to represent different cases safely.
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix
            it by creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile =

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E200] This issue means you're using the outdated Str module for regular
            expressions. Fix it by switching to the modern Re module: add 're' to your
            dune dependencies and replace Str functions with Re equivalents.
    â€¢ [E500] This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix
            it by creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile =

  ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:
    â€¢ [E205] This issue means you're using outdated Printf/Format modules for
