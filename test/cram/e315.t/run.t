    [E315] Type Naming Convention
    Type names should use snake_case. The primary type in a module should be named
    t, and identifiers should be id. This convention helps maintain consistency
    across the codebase.
    - bad.ml:1:0: bad.ml:1:0: Type name 'userProfile' should use snake_case: 'user_profile'
