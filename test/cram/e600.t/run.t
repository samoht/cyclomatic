    [E600] Test Module Convention (1 issue)
    Test executables (test.ml) should use test suites exported by test modules
    (test_*.ml) rather than defining their own test lists. This promotes
    modularity and ensures test modules are properly integrated.
    - bad/test.ml:1:0: Test file should use test module suites (e.g., Test_user.suite) instead of defining its own test list
