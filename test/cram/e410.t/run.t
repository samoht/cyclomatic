    [E410] Bad Documentation Style
    Documentation should follow OCaml conventions: start with a capital letter,
    end with a period, and use proper grammar. Avoid redundant phrases like 'This
    function...' - just state what it does directly.
    - bad.mli:3:0: Documentation for 'parse' use doc comment (** ... *) instead of regular comment (* ... *)
