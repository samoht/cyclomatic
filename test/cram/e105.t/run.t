    [E105] Catch-all Exception Handler
    This issue means you're catching all exceptions with a wildcard pattern, which
    can hide unexpected errors and make debugging difficult. Fix it by handling
    specific exceptions explicitly. If you must catch all exceptions, at least log
    them before re-raising or handling.
