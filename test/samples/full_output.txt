ðŸ’¡ Fix hints:

[E500] Missing Code Formatter
  This issue means your project lacks consistent code formatting. Fix it
  by
creating a .ocamlformat file in your project root with 'profile =
  default'
and a version number to ensure consistent formatting.

[E505] Missing Interface Files
  This issue means your modules lack interface files making their public
  API
unclear. Fix it by creating .mli files that document which functions
  and
types should be public. Copy public signatures from the .ml file and
  remove
private ones.
